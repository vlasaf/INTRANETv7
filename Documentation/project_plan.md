## Project Objectives
- Enable internal company employees to complete a variety of psychological assessments (HEXACO, SDS, SVS, PANAS, Self-Efficacy, PID-5-BF+M).

- Provide accurate scoring and result interpretation for all implemented tests.
- Store results in a structured manner for future analysis and potential HR applications.
- Offer a user-friendly interface for test selection and completion.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- User registration and data collection system.
- Implementation of the following tests:
    - HEXACO-PI-R (100 questions)
    - Self-Determination Scale (SDS - 10 questions)
    - Schwartz Value Survey (SVS - 57 items)
    - Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS - 20 items)
    - Self-Efficacy Test (J. Maddux, M. Scheer - 23 items)
    - Modified Personality Inventory (PID-5-BF+M - 36 items)
- Score calculation engines for all implemented tests.
- Local SQLite database for result storage (user responses and calculated scores).
- Russian language user interface.
- Test selection mechanism if multiple tests are uncompleted.
- Progress tracking within each test.
- Session management for individual user states and responses.
- Display of results and basic interpretations for each test.
- Bot deployment and configuration guidance (for local Windows environment).
- Logging for diagnostic and monitoring purposes.

### Out of Scope
- Cloud deployment or hosting
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Multiple language support (beyond Russian)
- Integration with external HR systems
- Complex user authentication beyond Telegram
- Mobile app development
- Test customization or question modification

### Phase 6: Documentation Update (Current Phase)
- [ ] Update `requirements_specification.md`
- [ ] Update `architecture_design.md`
- [ ] Update `dependencies.md`
- [ ] Update `project_plan.md` (this document)
- [ ] Update `iterations.md` with a summary of recent work
- [ ] Review and update `test_plan.md`, `risk_register.md`, etc.
- **Duration:** 1-2 days
- **Milestone:** All project documentation reflects the current state of the multi-test bot.

### Phase 7: Maintenance and Future Expansion (Ongoing)
- [ ] Address any new bugs or issues reported.
- [ ] Consider user feedback for improvements.
- [ ] Plan and implement any future tests or features as requested.
- **Duration:** Ongoing
- **Milestone:** Stable bot operation, documentation kept up-to-date.

## Detailed Task Breakdown
(This section previously detailed initial HEXACO development. For current and past detailed tasks, please refer to `iterations.md`. Key tasks for the current "Documentation Update" phase are listed in Phase 6 above.)

## Resource Allocation
- **Development Team:** 1 AI Assistant (Claude)
- **Development Environment:** Local Windows machine
- **Tools Required:** 
  - Python 3.7+
  - pyTelegramBotAPI library
  - SQLite database
  - Text editor/IDE
- **External Dependencies:** Telegram Bot API access

## Success Criteria
- [ ] User can complete full registration flow
- [ ] All implemented tests (HEXACO, SDS, SVS, PANAS, Self-Efficacy, PID-5-BF+M) can be selected and completed correctly.
- [ ] Scoring engines for all tests produce accurate results based on their methodologies.
- [ ] Results for all tests are stored correctly in the database (including `test_type`, `responses`, `scores_json`).
- [ ] Completed tests are not offered again to the user.
- [ ] Bot handles multiple concurrent users (basic verification).
- [ ] System deployed locally and functional.

## Risk Management Summary
- **High Risk:** Telegram API rate limiting
- **Medium Risk:** Complexity of maintaining and updating multiple test-specific logic paths.
- **Low Risk:** User interface usability issues with increased number of tests (mitigated by clear selection menu).

## Quality Metrics
- **Code Coverage:** Target 85%+ for scoring algorithms (for any newly added or significantly refactored scorers).
- **Response Time:** < 2-3 seconds for most interactions.
- **Accuracy:** 100% for all score calculations against their defined rules.
- **Uptime:** N/A for local deployment, focus on stability during active use.

## Communication Plan
- **Daily Updates:** Progress tracking in iterations.md
- **Issue Tracking:** problem_journal.md for any blockers
- **Change Requests:** change_log.md for scope modifications
- **Milestone Reviews:** discussion_summary.md updates

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **Complete Phase 6:** Documentation Update.
   - Finish updating `project_plan.md`.
   - Update `iterations.md` with a summary of the test integration and documentation effort.
   - Review and update `test_plan.md`, `risk_register.md`, and other relevant documents.
2. **Confirm all documentation is consistent and accurate.**
3. **Transition to Phase 7:** Maintenance and Future Expansion.
