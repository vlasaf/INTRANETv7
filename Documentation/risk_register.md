## Risk Categories

### Technical Risks

#### R001: Telegram API Rate Limiting
**Risk Score:** 12 (High)  
**Description:** Telegram API limits bots to 30 requests per second, which could be exceeded during peak usage with multiple concurrent users.  
**Impact:** Bot becomes unresponsive, users cannot complete tests, service degradation.  
**Likelihood:** Medium - likely with 50+ concurrent users  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Implement request queuing system
- Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Monitor API usage and implement throttling
- Use connection pooling to optimize requests
- Display user-friendly "processing" messages during delays

#### R002: pyTelegramBotAPI Library Dependency Failure
**Risk Score:** 10 (High)  
**Description:** Main library could have breaking changes, security vulnerabilities, or become deprecated.  
**Impact:** Complete bot failure, development halt, potential security issues.  
**Likelihood:** Low - but high impact  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Pin to specific tested version (4.11.0+)
- Monitor library updates and security advisories
- Have backup plan to migrate to python-telegram-bot (Trust Score: 8.3)
- Implement comprehensive error handling around library calls
- Regular dependency audits

#### R003: SQLite Database Issues
**Risk Score:** 8 (Medium)  
**Description:** Database corruption, locking issues, or performance degradation under concurrent access, potentially affecting results for multiple tests.  
**Impact:** Data loss, slow responses, test results corruption.  
**Likelihood:** Low - SQLite is stable, but concurrent access and larger data volume increase potential impact.
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Implement proper database connection management
- Use WAL mode for better concurrent access
- Regular database backups (manual for now, consider automation)
- Database integrity checks (manual for now)
- Connection timeout and retry mechanisms
- Store scores and responses as JSON to minimize schema changes per test.

#### R010: Inadequate Error Handling
**Risk Score:** 8 (Medium)  
**Description:** Unexpected errors in any of the test flows or core logic causing bot crashes or unhandled exceptions.  
**Impact:** Bot downtime, lost user sessions, poor user experience.  
**Likelihood:** Medium - complex interaction flows with multiple test paths.
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks around all external calls
- Graceful error messages in Russian
- Automatic session recovery mechanisms
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Health monitoring and alerts

#### R011: Increased complexity in maintaining/updating diverse test logics
**Risk Score:** 12 (High)
**Description:** As the number of tests grows, the complexity of the `QuestionHandler`, individual scorer logics, and data structures increases, making maintenance, debugging, and adding new features more challenging and error-prone.
**Impact:** Longer development times for new features/fixes, higher chance of introducing regressions, difficulty in onboarding new developers (if applicable).
**Likelihood:** Medium - inherent to feature growth.
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Maintain modular design: separate question files, scorer classes for each test.
- Ensure clear, well-documented interfaces between `QuestionHandler` and individual test modules.
- Write comprehensive unit/integration tests for each scorer and critical parts of `QuestionHandler`.
- Regular code reviews focusing on complexity and maintainability.
- Refactor common logic where possible, but avoid premature over-abstraction.
- Keep documentation (especially `architecture_design.md` and `iterations.md`) up-to-date with changes.

### Security Risks

#### R004: Bot Token Security Breach
**Risk Score:** 10 (High)  
**Description:** Bot token could be exposed in code, logs, or environment variables.  
**Impact:** Unauthorized bot access, data theft, bot hijacking.  
**Likelihood:** Low - but critical impact  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Store token in secure environment variables only
- Never log token in application logs
- Use .env files with proper .gitignore
- Regular token rotation (if compromised)
- Restrict bot permissions to minimum required

### Quality Risks

#### R005: Scoring Algorithm Errors (Any Test)
**Risk Score:** 15 (Critical)  
**Description:** Incorrect implementation of scoring methodology for any of the tests (HEXACO, SDS, SVS, PANAS, Self-Efficacy, PID-5-BF+M) leading to wrong assessments.  
**Impact:** Invalid test results, lost scientific validity, potentially incorrect user feedback/HR decisions.  
**Likelihood:** Medium - each test has unique, sometimes complex, scoring rules.
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Implement comprehensive unit tests for each Scorer module, covering all calculation paths, reverse scoring, special conditions.
- Validate against official scoring examples or manually calculated test cases for each test.
- Peer review of scoring implementations for each test.
- Document all scoring rules and edge cases per test in comments or related documentation.

#### R012: Increased testing time due to multiple tests
**Risk Score:** 9 (Medium)
**Description:** Each new test added, or any change affecting shared components (like `QuestionHandler` or `DatabaseManager`), requires re-testing of all or most existing test flows to ensure no regressions.
**Impact:** Slower release cycles, potential for rushing tests and missing bugs, increased effort for QA.
**Likelihood:** Medium - directly proportional to the number of tests.
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Develop a comprehensive `test_plan.md` covering all test cases for all tests.
- Automate testing where possible, especially for scoring logic (unit tests) and critical E2E flows.
- Prioritize regression testing for areas most likely to be affected by a change.
- Use a checklist for manual testing of each test flow after significant changes.
- Allocate sufficient time for testing in project planning for new features or major refactors.

### Performance Risks

#### R006: Session Management Memory Leaks
**Risk Score:** 6 (Low)  
**Description:** Memory leaks in session management (especially with more complex `UserSession` objects holding data for multiple tests) causing bot to slow down or crash over time.  
**Impact:** Degraded performance, eventual bot failure, restart required.  
**Likelihood:** Low - Python's GC is generally effective, but complex objects need care.
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Implement proper session cleanup mechanisms
- Use context managers for resource management
- Regular memory usage monitoring
- Session timeout and cleanup (24 hours)
- Restart mechanism for long-running instances

### Business Risks

#### R007: User Test Abandonment (Long Tests)
**Risk Score:** 9 (Medium)  
**Description:** Users abandoning lengthy tests (e.g., HEXACO - 100q, SVS - 57q) or if the overall process of taking multiple tests feels too long.  
**Impact:** Incomplete data, low user engagement for certain tests, skewed overall results if users only complete shorter tests.  
**Likelihood:** Medium - length is a known factor, but offering multiple tests gives choice.
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Implement progress indicators (Question X of Y) for all tests.
- Ensure session management robustly saves progress for each test independently.
- Clear communication about test length in introductory messages.
- Engaging progress messages and encouragement.
- Consider if any very long tests can be broken into parts (if methodology allows - currently not planned).
- Provide a clear overview of all tests and allow users to choose the order or skip tests (already implemented).

### External Risks

#### R008: Telegram Service Downtime
**Risk Score:** 8 (Medium)  
**Description:** Telegram servers experiencing downtime or connectivity issues.  
**Impact:** Bot completely inaccessible, tests cannot be completed.  
**Likelihood:** Low - Telegram has good uptime  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Monitor Telegram service status
- Implement connection retry mechanisms
- Cache critical data locally during outages
- Inform users about service dependencies
- Have communication channels outside Telegram

#### R009: Windows Environment Issues
**Risk Score:** 3 (Very Low)  
**Description:** Windows-specific compatibility issues with Python or dependencies, less likely with standard libraries.
**Impact:** Deployment failures, runtime errors, maintenance difficulties.
**Likelihood:** Very Low - Python well-supported on Windows, project uses common libraries.
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Test on target Windows environment early
- Use virtual environments for isolation
- Document exact environment setup
- Have deployment checklist
- Consider containerization as backup plan
